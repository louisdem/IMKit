  * The ICQ add-on is built by the enclosed makefiles, but it requires that you
    download and build/install the following libraries. If you don't wish to
    build the add-on then remove the entry from src/protocols/makefile.
    - libsigc++ (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libsigc/)
      Get version 1.0.4 of libsigc++, I don't think 1.2.x will compile on BeOS.
    Configure with --prefix=/boot/home/config and "make install" them.
    - libicq2000 (http://libicq2000.sourceforge.net/)

Building libicq2k:
Edit "configure", add "-lbind" where it says "LIBS += -lsocket" or some such.

Run "configure --prefix=/boot/home/config"

In "examples/Select.cpp", move "using std::make_pair;" on line 41 to line 29.

In "src/Makefile":

Change the line:
	CXXLINK = $(LIBTOOL) --mode=link $(CXXLD) $(AM_CXXFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) 
to:
	CXXLINK = $(LIBTOOL) --mode=link $(CXXLD) -no-undefined  $(AM_CXXFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) 

and add "-lstdc++.r4" to the line with "-lsocket -lbind".

run "make" and then "make install".

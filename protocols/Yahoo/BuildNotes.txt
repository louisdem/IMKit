You need to fetch and install libyahoo2.

http://libyahoo2.sf.net/

To get it to build you need to fiddle a bit with the makefile:

add -lbind where appropriate (right after -lsocket), and remove -ansi
from the compiler flags if you want the sample client to compile (not
sure if this is really needed or not)

configure --prefix=/boot/home/config, as usual.

You need to fetch and install libyahoo2.

http://libyahoo2.sf.net/

We've been using 0.7.4, not sure if other versions will work.

To get it to build you need to fiddle a bit with the makefile:

	configure --prefix=/boot/home/config  --with-struct-callbacks

Then edit src/makefile:

	where it says -lsocket, also add -lbind on the same line, right after -lsocket.

	remove -ansi from the CFLAGS line

	change the line:
		LINK = $(LIBTOOL) --mode=link $(CCLD) $(AM_CFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) \
	to:
		LINK = $(LIBTOOL) --mode=link $(CCLD) -no-undefined  $(AM_CFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) \

Edit src/sample_client.c, line 1020: 

	change (socklen_t*) to (int*)

Then you should be able to run "make ; make install", after which the Yahoo add-on
should compile.

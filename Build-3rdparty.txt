IM Kit - Building within Haiku source tree
==========================================

Put IM Kit source code into $HAIKUDIR/3rdparty/IMKit, where $HAIKUDIR is Haiku
source code directory.

You need to be sure OpenSSL optional package will be installed into the image.
Add the following line to $HAIKUDIR/build/jam/UserBuildConfig:

AddOptionalHaikuImagePackages OpenSSL ;

If you are building InfoPopper too, put this line at the end of your
$HAIKUDIR/build/jam/UserBuildConfig:

IMKIT_HAVE_INFOPOPPER = 1 ;

Your $HAIKUDIR/build/jam/UserBuildConfig must have this line at the end:

DeferredSubInclude HAIKU_TOP 3rdparty IMKit : Jamfile.haiku ;

Now download the OpenSSL optional package and uncompress it to let gtalk and msn
protocol add-ons link to the library.  Latest OpenSSL package at the time this
document was written is openssl-0.9.8g-gcc2-2008-03-28.zip.

$ mkdir -p generated/download
$ mkdir -p generated/cross-ssl
$ cd generated/download
$ wget http://haiku-files.org/files/optional-packages/openssl-0.9.8g-gcc2-2008-03-28.zip
$ cd ../cross-ssl
$ unzip ../download/openssl-0.9.8g-gcc2-2008-03-28.zip

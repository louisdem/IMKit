You'll need to symlink your SoundPlay executable to this directory and name the symlink _APP_ before building.

After building you'll need to copy / symlink the file obj.x86/SPInfoPopper to your SoundPlay plugin dir. Which is the "plugin" dir in your SoundPlay directory

Album covers can be placed in;
~/config/settings/BeClan/InfoPopper/SoundPlay/AlbumCovers/{Artist Name}_{Album Name}
But don't get too comfortable with this, it'll be changed

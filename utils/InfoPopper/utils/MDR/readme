bin:
contains pre-compiled add-ons . One for MDR 2.x and one for 3.x.
the 2.x one is a bit broken, but since I don't have 2.x any more
I didn't bother fixing it. A re-compile should do it.

src: 
contains code for compiling the add-on. You need to place it in
the right dir to make it work, though. For 3.x it should go in the
haiku/current/src/kits/mail folder. Then a make should work.
For 2.x, I think it's supposed to be in the filter folder.

If someone wants to test and verify these instructions, and then
update this file, feel free to do so!

Compiling the code

First of all, a few notes: 

  * Running make will create a dir src/build where binaries are placed. Just so
    you know where to look for it.

  * When running "make install" the Tracker add-ons will be installed directly 
    in ~/config/add-ons/Tracker where they belong.

  * The ICQ add-on is built by the enclosed makefiles, but it requires that you
    download and build/install the following libraries. If you don't wish to
    build the add-on then remove the entry from src/protocols/makefile.
    - libsigc++ (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libsigc/)
      Get version 1.0.4 of libsigc++, I don't think 1.2.x will compile on BeOS.
    - libicq2000 (http://libicq2000.sourceforge.net/)
    Configure both with --prefix=/boot/home/config and "make install" them.

Now, on to the making:

  To compile do this 
     1. Open a Terminal 
     2. Change to the imkit/src folder 
     3. Run "make" 
     4. Run "make install"

Simple enough.

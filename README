Compiling the code

First of all, a few notes: 

  * Running make will create a dir src/build where binaries are placed. Just so
    you know where to look for it.

  * When running "make install" the Tracker add-ons will be installed directly 
    in ~/config/add-ons/Tracker where they belong, libim.so will be placed in
    ~/config/lib and im_server in ~/config/servers.

Now, on to the making:

  To compile do this 
     1. Open a Terminal 
     2. Change to the imkit/src folder 
     3. Run "make install" twice

Simple enough.

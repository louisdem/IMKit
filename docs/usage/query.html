<h2>Queries</h2>


<p>The Instant Messenger kit makes use of <a href="../../../../system/query.html">queries</a> and attributes. You can easily create your own queries for this 
  chat solution, and use them as your buddy lists. </p>
<p>Go to the Deskbar and choose Find, or hit <!-- <img src="../../../system/tracker/graphics/alt-key.png" width="38" height="30"> + <img src="../../../system/tracker/graphics/f-key.png" width="30" height="30"> --> ALT + F in a Tracker related window or after first having clicked on the 
  desktop. </p>
<p><img src="graphics/query.png" width="448" height="148"></p>
<p>In the Query application, choose what file type you want to be 
  searched after by clicking on the pop-down menu <i>All files and 
    folders</i>. In this pop-down menu, first choose application, and 
  from the application's sub-menu, choose Person. </p>
<p><img src="graphics/im-query2.png" width="460" height="643"></p>
<p>The Query we want to do, is related to the Person files. Choose 
  By attribute from the pop-down menu Name and then that you only 
  want to do the Query on your boot partition (here: Zeta). If you 
  have other BeOS systems on the computer, you can choose All disks. </p>
<p>&lt;screenshot&gt;</p>
<p>As you set the Query type to attribute, a new pop-down menu appears 
  and you can choose between all attributes related to that file type. 
  In the bottom of this menu, you will find the attributes that you 
  made when installing the Instant Messenger kit, <i>IM Connections</i> and <i>IM Status</i>. Choose <i>IM Status</i>, and specify the query 
  to be exact (<i>Is</i>). The exact words that we want to do a query 
  on are <i>Available</i>, <i>Away</i> and <i>Offline</i>, and will 
  show us all our friends that are using one of the supported IM protocols. </p>
<p>&lt;screenshot&gt;</p>
<p>To get the query correct, each <i>IM Status</i> have to be separated 
  with <i>Or</i> (instead of the default And).</p>

<p>If you find this query useful, you can save it for later use by 
  giving it a name and dragging the query icon to the desktop or add 
  them to <i>/boot/home/config/settings/im_kit/Queries</i>. If you 
  add your saved queries to this folder, they will be accessable from 
  the im_kit's replicant in the Deskbar.</p>

<p>The Live Queries are system wide and can be seen in a various of 
  applications making use of the People files and in the operating 
  system it self. In the Recent applications you can also see with 
  who you recently had a chat with and the online status they have 
  now, and start a new chat with them. </p>

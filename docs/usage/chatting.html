<h2>Starting a Chat </h2>






<p>To start a chat using the im_client with a person, you will first 
  have to check if the person is available for a chat or not. There 
  are three statuses in the IM kit: Available, Away and Offline. The 
  easiest way to see if they are available for a chat is by accessing 
  the IM kit's Deskbar replicant and choose Queries. In the Queries 
  sub menu, you can choose the default Query. This will open a query 
  window that lists all your online friends:</p>
<p><img src="graphics/deskbar-queries-overview.png" alt="imkit-deskbar-queries" width="295" height="193"></p>
<p>Instead of making use of live queries, you can use the tool <a href="utilities.html#im_contactlist">im_contactlist</a>. </p>
<p>An im_client window will stay where you put it (unless you click the  deskbar icon when there is a pending message, then it'll bring a window  with a pending message to the current workspace). But in the case where  there is no window associated with a user it'll pop up a window on the  current workspace. </p>

<h2><strong>Emoicons - Emotion icons (smileys)</strong></h2>
<p>The IM kit also comes with an alternative chat client, the im_emoclient. 
  One of the most popluar features when it comes to instant messaging 
  is emo icons, the possibility to add icons in the end of a sentence 
  to show that you are happy or sad. A smiley is a representation 
  of a smiling face, most often coloured in yellow, so also in Zeta:</p>
<p><img src="graphics/smiley.png" width="571" height="354"></p>
<p>The are two ways to add emoicons to a sentence that you are about 
  to send to the person you are chatting with. The first way is to 
  choose the icon from a menu accessable from the im_client's toolbar. 
  The second way is to use the signs for the emoicons in the tying 
  area in the im_client:</p>
<table width="128" border="0">
  <tr valign="top">
    <td width="32">&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="8">&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="66">:)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>;)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>:D</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>:p</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td valign="top">:(</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>:|</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>:`(</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>(l)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>With the IM kit you can also choose them from the menu bar and 
  in the default emoicon theme, the following icons are available:</p>
<p><img src="graphics/smileys.png" width="239" height="245"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The IM kit comes with the default emoicon 
  size set to 16, so that they shouldn't be to appearing compared 
  to the text in the chat window. Never the less many users would 
  like to have them bigger. The icons and their size has been set 
  in <em>/boot/home/config/settings/im_kit </em>... . As you open the 
  settings file in your default text editor, search for &lt;size&gt;. 
  As mentioned before, change the size 16 to your preferred size. 
  In this example set to size 40.</p>

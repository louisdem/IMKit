Fixes

* SET_STATUS - If no protocol is provided, send to all loaded protocols.
* Strangeness when getting the server based contact list. Contact info messages duplicated? Not indexed?

* Add status changes to im_logger?
* Smart protocol selection, if contact is online on any service, use that etc
* Fix ICQ add-on 'message received' string

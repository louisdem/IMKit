This is a list of bugs that need to be fixed, features that have been requested and such. If you
feel like coding something and don't know what to do, this is the place to go! :)


___ Things to fix

* Protocol doc needs to be updated and extended to describe Deskbar add-on and probably more.
* Strangeness with getting contact info, error in icq-addon or in im_server, or both?
* long message bug in LOG(), make buffer dynamic somehow?
* Add Deskbar monitor for im_server, so it restores the deskbar icon if needed.
* Add "Send" button to client
* Don't use BAlert in Merge contacts, it doesn't play well with long filenames
* Alt-C in client doesn't work
* Extract Deskbar icon from im_server, let it live it's own life
* Contact's BNode::SetTo crashes with invalid pointer sometimes? Due to Zeta bug?
* Fix Preflet so it reads SVG icons(?)
* im_client: when settings are changed, make them apply to existing windows too
* "Command sends message" settings description needs improvement
* MSN and AIM: Add support for UNREGISTER_CONTACTS message


___ New features

Auto-send a user defined message to blocked contacts if they send a message (don't send again
if already sent the last ten seconds, to prevent ping pong flood)

Auto-reconnect if disconnected by server - should this be in im_server or in protocol?

Change Merge contacts, or make a new one, so it can be used from the Terminal

Option to disable logging (im_logger and LOG() output)

Setting for im_server: default log level

Scrollable settings in preflet

Protocol icons in Info Popper status updates

Invisibility

Connect/disconnect sounds

New setting: Play sound on -every- message receive

More attributes for info like timezone, location, etc?

Option for im_server - Don't fetch serverside contact lists

Message filters - For implementing things like transparent encryption etc (key as attribute?)

* More possible statuses, like Busy etc. Separate into sub-status? Away:Working, Away:Busy etc
* Add a new attribute, IM Specific Status, for network-specific status (well, d'uh.)
For things like "out to lunch" or whatever messages you can set on e.g. MSN.

Log in invisible for ICQ

File transfers

Serverside contact list manager:
	Search for contacts
		IM:SEARCH_FOR_CONTACTS ( string:name, string:nick, string:email, string:id )
		IM:SEARCH_RESULTS ( protocol, name, email, id, whatever info we can get )
		IM:SEARCH_COMPLETED (protocol)
		IM:STOP_SEARCH (stops the currently active search(?))
	Remove contacts
		IM:REMOVE_SERVERSIDE_CONTACT (protocol, id)
	Sort contacts in groups
		IM:GET_SERVERSIDE_GROUPS (protocol)
		IM:GET_CONTACTS_IN_SERVERSIDE_GROUP (protocol, group)
		IM:MOVE_CONTACT_TO_SERVERSIDE_GROUP (protocol, id, group)

New client: Relay station
* Forward all messages received from !relay_target to relay_target

Features in sample_client
* Smileys

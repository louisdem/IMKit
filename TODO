Fixes

* Protocol doc needs to be updated and extended to describe Deskbar add-on and probably more.
* Strangeness when getting the server based contact list. Contact info messages duplicated? Not indexed?
* Getting name, nick etc doesn't always work, it seems. Look into this. No IM:status?
* Add status changes to im_logger?
* Smart protocol selection, if contact is online on any service, use that etc
* Deskbar icon. show current status in Set status menu
* convert_to_utf8() on names etc, ICQ add-on
* UIN set as nickname?
* ChatWindow - resize problems with textview?

New features

More possible statuses, like Busy etc. Separate into sub-status? Away:Working, Away:Busy etc

"Autostart clients" in im_server (shut them down, too)

Log in invisible for ICQ

File transfers - need new icqlib?

Search for contacts

New client: Relay station
* Forward all messages received from !relay_target to relay_target

Features in sample_client

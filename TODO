Things to fix

* Protocol doc needs to be updated and extended to describe Deskbar add-on and probably more.
* Strangeness when getting the server based contact list. Contact info messages duplicated? Not indexed?
* Getting name, nick etc doesn't always work, it seems. Look into this. No IM:status?
* Add status changes to im_logger?
* Strangeness with getting contact info, error in icq-addon or in im_server, or both?
* im_server: Monitor People files and remove from interest list if a connection attribute is removed
* long message bug in LOG(), make buffer dunamic somehow?
* Add Deskbar monitor for im_server, so it restores the deskbar icon if needed.
* Add "Send" button to client, for those poor souls who don't know that cmd-enter == send
* Add option to client - multi/single line edit
* Don't use BAlert in Merge contacts, it doesn't play well with long filenames
* Change Merge contacts, or make a new one, so it can be used from the Terminal
* Client: not scrolling correctly in conversation when opening a conversation with a history
* When running Zeta: reused message from sending message is corrupted somewhere along the line. Fixed?
* Crash in BubbleHelper, ...( FindView( WindowAt() ) ). Does this still happen?
* Add check for Blocked everywhere we change status: status update, connect, disconnect, etc. Fixed?
* Alt-C in client doesn't work
* Option to disable logging (im_logger and LOG() output)
* Extract Deskbar icon from im_server, let it live it's own life
* Change Preflet so it can run when im_server isn't running, and also start im_server
* Change im_server so it touches contact files when updating their status
* Contact's BNode::SetTo crashes with invalid pointer sometimes?
* Settings for clients

New features

Invisibility

Connect/disconnect sounds

Play sound on -every- message receive?

Add a new attribute, IM Specific Status, for network-specific status (well, d'uh.)
For things like "out to lunch" or whatever messages you can set on e.g. MSN.

Status notification client, like in MSN (and BeMSN! :)

More attributes for info like timezone, location, etc?

Option for im_server - Don't fetch serverside contact lists

Block contact - status set to "Blocked" => ignore incoming messages?

Message filters - For implementing things like transparent encryption etc (key as attribute?)

More possible statuses, like Busy etc. Separate into sub-status? Away:Working, Away:Busy etc

Log in invisible for ICQ

File transfers - need new icqlib?

Serverside contact list manager:
	Search for contacts
		IM:SEARCH_FOR_CONTACTS ( string:name, string:nick, string:email, string:id )
		IM:SEARCH_RESULTS ( protocol, name, email, id, whatever info we can get )
		IM:SEARCH_COMPLETED (protocol)
		IM:STOP_SEARCH (stops the currently active search(?))
	Remove contacts
		IM:REMOVE_SERVERSIDE_CONTACT (protocol, id)
	Sort contacts in groups
		IM:GET_SERVERSIDE_GROUPS (protocol)
		IM:GET_CONTACTS_IN_SERVERSIDE_GROUP (protocol, group)
		IM:MOVE_CONTACT_TO_SERVERSIDE_GROUP (protocol, id, group)

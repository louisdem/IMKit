Fixes

* SET_STATUS - If no protocol is provided, send to all loaded protocols.
* Strangeness when getting the server based contact list. Contact info messages duplicated?
* Getting name, nick etc doesn't always work, it seems. Look into this. No IM:status?
* Add status changes to logger?
* Smart protocol selection, if contact is online on any service, use that etc
